WARNING: this is only for demonstration purposes and as such should not be used in
any real code, as it is unfinished and unsafe. 


INSTRUCTIONS:

please make sure that you have properly built libgit2.so and installed in some
default lib search paths on your system. If you do not wish to install libgit2.so
in some default search path modify config.m4 as :

delete or comment:

	PHP_ADD_LIBRARY(git2,1,GIT_REPO_MOD_SHARED_LIBADD)

add:

	PHP_ADD_LIBRARY_WITH_PATH(git2,PATH_TO_LIB_FOLDER,GIT_REPO_MOD_SHARED_LIBADD)

replace PATH_TO_LIB_FOLDER with path to folder where your lib resides

you may also modify path in:

	CXXFLAGS="$CXXFLAGS -DLIB_GIT_HEADER=/var/libgit2/include/git2.h"

to one where your git2.h resides

TO BUILD:
	cd to zend_ext/ folder
run:
	phpize
	./coonfigure --enable-git_repo_mod
	make

if you wish to install extension in standard php estension (THIS IS NOT RECOMENDED FOR
 DEVELOPERS) run:

	sudo make install

it is not recommended for developers because you are expected to build this extension
regurarly and it is nuisance to run this command every time you do so.

TO ENABLE:

add to your php.ini file:
	
	extension=git_repo_mod.so

or if you haven't run sudo make install add:

	extension=PATH_TO_BUKSY/buksy/src/cpp/zend_ext/modules/git_repo_mod.so

make sure you have added this to your php.ini file usually found in /etc/php5/apache2/ 

DO NOT include this extension by making additional .ini file in /etc/php5/apache2/conf.d/
this may or may not work, and at this time it STRONGLY recomended not to do it as couse
of strange behaviour is not known

TO CLEAN:

run in this order:
	make clean
	phpize --clean

please note that this will also delete extension .so if it hasn't been moved
