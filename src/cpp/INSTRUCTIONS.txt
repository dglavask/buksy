INSTALLATION:

download libgit2

	$ git clone https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2.git 

build using standard instructions

	$ mkdir build && cd build
	$ cmake ..
	$ cmake --build .

move produced .so files in desired location usually 
/usr/lib

now in THIS(as in folder of this file that you are readinig
right now) open make.conf

	$vim make.conf

here you can setup all compile and linking options: 

name of libgit .so file usually it is libgit2.so but 
variable static_libs it goeas without prefix "lib" and
extension ".so" like:

	static_libs:=git2 

also you can ad any number of libs for linking here just 
separate them with space.

next we configure locations of libs in variable lib_dirs as:

	lib_dirs:= /var/mylibs 

if your libs are in standard lib search folders you can leave
this variable empty

finally set up absolute path to your git2.h file from libgit2
folder as: 

	lib_git_header_path :=/var/libgit2/include/git2.h

BUILDING:

in terminal cd to buksy/cpp
	
	example:
	$cd ~/buksy/cpp

build
	$ make

to clean folder from all build files:

	$make clean 


IMPORATANT FINAL NOTICE:

if you are cloning repository and want to commit please 
set make.conf to be ignored by git:

	$ git update-index --assume-unchanged make.conf

reason for this is simple: you don't want to commint your 
local buid configuration is it impolite at best, also be 
sure that you ignore build folder (default build folder i 
is in .gitignore already) or any editor or GUI settings
